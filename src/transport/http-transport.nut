   * When the send method is called, it calls
   * connectionInfo.getHttp().post(connectionInfo.getUrl(), connectionInfo.getHeaders(), buffer)

   * blob for the body of the POST message. The "post" method returns
   * an object which has a method sendasync where this calls
   * sendasync(doneCallback, null, connectionInfo.getTimeoutSeconds()).
   * When the HTTP response is received, the system calls
   * doneCallback(response) where response.body
   * is the raw string of the response. This converts the response to a Buffer
   * and calls elementListener.onReceivedElement(). In this way this Transport
   * can be used to POST a packet to an HTTP server and receive the response,
   * but it does not listen for other nodes to initiate an incoming HTTP
   * connection. This follows the API of the Imp http.post method, but another
   * object for connectionInfo.getHttp() can be set up to behave the same way.
